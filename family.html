<p><font color = "Purple" size = "20" >M</font>y father's name is Cyril A. Quincena , my mother's name is Ma.Concepcion S. Quincena ,and my brother's name is Jerome S. Quincena.
I could begin the book of my life with a picture of my parents.
They are important because they helped in my development. 
Also, they gave me the things that I needed <p>to grow up 
in the moment that I needed and 
they still gave me everything that I needed to become somebody in the future
.Among these things is the education that I<p> have  received all in my life,
my basic needs like food, clothes, medicine, a place to live, and the most important thing, the love.
Like for example, by being there when I <p>need  somebody to talk to and giving me speeches when I do something wrong.
And also, they care for me when I am sick and they give me the necessary things to get<p> better .
 <br><font color = Blue size = "20">T</font>hey teach me good values like how to behave, to respect other people, and to share with other people.
Sometimes they push me in certain directions and have high expectations for me, 
but now I really appreciate everything they have taught me.
I understand why they do certain things and it is because my parents want the best <p>for  me. 
On certain occasions I get mad, but later appreciate their words of wisdom and understand. My parents are wonderful.
