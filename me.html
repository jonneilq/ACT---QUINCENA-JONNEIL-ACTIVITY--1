<p><b><font color = "DeepPink " size = "20" >H</font>ey , this is my homepage,  so I have to say something about myself.
 Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not <p>know where to start with. 
 Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description.
 I hope that my impression about myself and <br> </br> your  impression about me are not so different. Here it goes. </p></p></p>
 
 
<img src="4.gif" align="left">

<p><font color= "MediumSpringGreen " size="20" >I</font> am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.  There are many
things I like to do, to see, and to experience.  I like to read, I like to
write; I like to <p>think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen.
I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at
night; I like to feel the music flowing <br> </br> on my face, I like to smell the
wind coming from the ocean.  I like to look at the clouds in the sky with
a blank mind, I like to do experiment when I cannot sleep <br> </br> in the
middle of the night.  I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in
autumn, and snow in winter.  I like new clothes, I like to get up late;
I like to be surrounded <br> </br> by people.  I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies.  I like
the land and the nature, I like people.  And, I like to laugh. 
</p>
<img src= "1.gif" align="right">
<p><font color= "MediumOrchid " size="20" >I</font> come from an upper middle class family. The most important thing in my life is religious believes, 
moral values & respect for elders. I am modern <p>thinker but also believe in good values given by our ancestors. I love trekking, going on trips with friends,
 listening to classical music & watching latest <br> </br>movies. This is a brief introduction of myself.
